# TODO

## Mob AI
- Dark anchors for mob rest points (mobs seek safety when hurt)

## Foraging
- Props modify forage results (ferns drop fiddleheads, blueberry bushes drop berries)
- Terrain modifies forage results (kelp in ponds, mushrooms in caves)

## Combat
- Can't move (get lagged) when being attacked

## Nightstorm
- "Endure the worst of night" timing off - should trigger at start of nightstorm
